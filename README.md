## Variables
* You can assign variables before your code by doing ```a == 1 or b == 2```.
* Then you can use those assigned variables in your code. ```Example: return (a * b)```
* The different types of variables you can use are **Strings, Numbers, and Boolean** ```Example- "Hello World", a == 5, True False```

## Conditionals
* Conditional expressions are things like if and else statements
```Example if a == 0:```
          ```return True```
* Branching is when you can use multiple of these statements
```Example if a == 0:```
          ```return True```
            ```else:```
                ```return False```

##Functions
* There are many different types of functions you can use. One example would be a print function. You can use this to print something that you code.
```Example a == 4```
        ```b == 5```
        ```print (a * b)```
